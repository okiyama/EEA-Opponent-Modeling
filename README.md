EEA-Opponent-Modeling
=====================

This is the repository for my senior year thesis.

The basic research question I am exploring is, "How good is the [Estimation Exploration Algorithm](http://www.igi.tugraz.at/lehre/SeminarA/WS07/neumann_2007.pdf) for opponent modeling?"

I will be exploring this question by using the EEA to try to accurately model an opponent's static evaluator
in Chess. That means that the EEA will be using chess moves as a means of probing the hidden system that is
the opponent. The hope is that, over time the EEA will be able to evolve the static evaluator of a chess engine
to fit to what the opponent is doing so that it may predict the opponent's next move accurately.
